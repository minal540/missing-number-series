I built a Python app that solves number series automatically. It uses functions to detect patterns like arithmetic, geometric, Fibonacci, and others. The GUI is built with Tkinter so it's easy for anyone to use â€” you just enter the series and it shows the missing number with logic.
# ðŸ§  Missing Number Series Solver (Python GUI)

This is a Python-based intelligent solver designed to **predict missing values in number series** â€” a common question type in competitive exams like **SBI PO**, **IBPS**, **RBI Grade B**, and other aptitude tests.

It uses various algorithmic techniques to detect patterns in number series and provide step-by-step solutions using a **Tkinter-based GUI**.

## ðŸ”§ Features

âœ… Supports detection of:
- Arithmetic Progression  
- Geometric Progression  
- Fibonacci Series  
- Alternating Patterns  
- Custom Cube + 1 Patterns (e.g., +11Â³ + 1, +9Â³ + 1, etc.)  
- Linear Increasing Differences (e.g., +16, +18, +20...)  

âœ… Easy-to-use GUI with input box  
âœ… Step-by-step explanation of the pattern  
âœ… Designed for students and banking exam aspirants
